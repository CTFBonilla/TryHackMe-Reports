This repository is mainly for personal use. It contains my adhoc notes and work for TryHackMe. Nothing here is an official "write-up" of any machine.

Also, many nmap scans have -T5, this is only because the targets were unmonitored VMs intended for practice and I wanted to get nmap scans over quickly.
