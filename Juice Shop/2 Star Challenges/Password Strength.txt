Used Burp to intercept a test login POST request designed to fail and sent it to Burp Intruderer.

In Burp Intruder edited the "email" field value in the request to "admin@juice-sh.op". 
Set attack type to Sniper and sections to the "password" field value. 
Set Payload to Simple List using SecLists' best1050.txt.

Started attack and successfully brute-forced the admin account password: "admin123".
