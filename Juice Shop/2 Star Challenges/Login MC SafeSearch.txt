Looking up "MC SafeSearch" led to a Youtube video by CollegeHumor. It was a music video in which the musician raps about password security.

In the first verse he says 
	"I say, 'Why not use the first name of your favorite pet?'
	Mine's my dog, Mr. Noodles. It don't matter if you know
	'Cause I was tricky and replaced some vowels with zeroes"

This suggests his password is Mr. N00dles.

Trying to login to mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op with password "Mr. N00dles" succeeds.
