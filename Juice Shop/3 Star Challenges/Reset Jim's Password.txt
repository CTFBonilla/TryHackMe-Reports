Went to forgot password page and entered Jim's email found during Recon under product reviews.

His security question is "Your eldest siblings middle name?"
	Side-note: lack of an apostrophe is "siblings" is suggestive of SQL.

Jim referenced Star Trek several times in reviews. I'm a nerd and know James Kirk's oldest brother is George Samuel Kirk, thoguh one could simply research "Jim Star Trek" and find the answer.

Using "Samuel" as the answer to the Security Question allowed me to change Jim's password.
