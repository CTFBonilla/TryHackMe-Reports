Used Burp to intercept a test login POST request designed to fail and sent it to Burp Repeater.

In Burp Repeater edited the "email" field value in the request to "'". Response was a verbose SQLite Error. 

Intercepted the request again and changed the "email" value to "bender@juice-sh.op'--".

Succesfully logged in as bender@juice-sh.op
